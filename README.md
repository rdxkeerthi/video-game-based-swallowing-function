# Video Game Based Swallowing Function

This project is focused on developing a system that uses video game mechanics to assess and possibly rehabilitate swallowing function. The primary goal is to create an engaging, interactive environment for users that can be used in clinical or research settings related to swallowing disorders.

## Overview

Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) are a significant health issue. This project aims to leverage video game interactions to both assess and support therapy for individuals with swallowing difficulties, providing feedback and progress tracking.

## Features

- Interactive video game environment
- Data collection on swallowing performance
- Upload feature for user/session/game data
- Modular design for testing various game mechanics

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rdxkeerthi/video-game-based-swallowing-function.git
   cd video-game-based-swallowing-function
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   - (Specify dependencies here, e.g., Python, Unity, etc.)

3. **Run the application:**

   ``` - python3 main.py```

## Pseudo Code for Upload Functionality

Below is a high-level pseudo code for how the upload functionality (for user data or game sessions) could be implemented in this project:

```pseudo
function uploadSessionData(sessionData, userId):
    if not isValid(sessionData):
        return "Invalid session data"

    // Prepare data for upload (e.g., convert to JSON)
    formattedData = formatForUpload(sessionData, userId)

    // Connect to server or database
    connection = connectToServer("https://your-server-endpoint/upload")

    if connection is successful:
        response = connection.send(formattedData)
        if response.status == SUCCESS:
            return "Upload successful"
        else:
            return "Upload failed: " + response.errorMessage
    else:
        return "Could not connect to server"
```

### Steps Explained

1. **Validate** the session data to ensure it's correct and complete.
2. **Format** the data as required by your backend (e.g., JSON).
3. **Connect** to the backend server or database for storing data.
4. **Upload** the formatted data.
5. **Handle** the server's response and notify the user of success or failure.
